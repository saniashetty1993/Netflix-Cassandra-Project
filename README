NetFlix Movie Prediction model via Ratings

**************************************************************************
SUMMARY
**************************************************************************
Netflix has come to dominate the online entertainment space. The primary reason behind their success is the ease of finding movie content online.
 They have a huge repository of movies and other entertainment choices. Each movie is classified by their genre, ratings and even region thus,
 making it easier for the user to decide on the movie based on their choice. We will be making use of the dataset of all the movies and ratings
 provided by each user by developing a recommendation system to suggest similar movie choices.Our recommendation system will be employing machine
 learning techniques to predict movies for each user based on their interests. The highest rated movie will always be displayed on the top thus,
 making the recommendation system smart and accurate. This would in turn increase the probability of users renting or purchasing a movie.
 This would help Netflix maintain and enhance its customer base making it a sustainable business model in the online entertainment space
